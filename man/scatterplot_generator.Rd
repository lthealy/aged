\arguments{
\item{aged_results}{The results of a successful call to \code{AGED}}

\item{data}{The original dataset that was plugged into the initial call of \code{AGED}}

\item{gene}{A string value perfectly corresponding to a row value of the original dataset, representing a gene name.}

\item{clear_low_variance}{A boolean variable that determines whether or not rows with variance less than 1 should be removed from the original dataset.}

\item{transformation_type}{A string variable that determines whether or not a log or VST transformation should be done on the original dataset. If this argument is intended to be used to perform a transformation, it should be "vst" or "log" only.}

\item{blind}{If a VST is to be done, this boolean value determines whether it is blind or not.}

\item{x_axis}{A string value representing what data should be plotted. The value should be one of: "h" or "wh" only.}

\item{color}{A string vector representation of size \code{n} where \code{n} equals the number of samples. This vector should detail how each sample should be categorized and colored within each scatterplot. Using a column from a dataset's sample information dataframe is common. For example, one might want to separate points in the scatterplots by treatment or batch. Each treatment, batch, or category will be represented by a different color.}

\item{shape}{A string vector representation of size \code{n} where \code{n} equals the number of samples. This vector should detail how each sample should be categorized and represented within each scatterplot. Using a column from a dataset's sample information dataframe is common. For example, one might want to separate points in the scatterplots by treatment or batch. Each treatment, batch, or category will be represented by a different shape.}

\item{reg}{A boolean value representing whether a solid, linear regression line should be added to the plot.}

\item{reg_color}{If a linear regression line is added to the scatterplot, this string value should represent the color of that line.}

\item{xy}{A boolean value representing whether or not a dotted x = y should be added to the plot. This is typically not applicable to "h".}

\item{xy_color}{If an x = y line is added to the scatterplot, this string value should represent the color of that line.}

\item{ellipse}{A boolean value representing whether or not ellipses should be added to the scatterplot. These ellipses will create normal confidence ellipses based on the "color" vector parameter.}
}
\value{
Returns a scatterplot containing the desired gene expression values. This function also plots it for you.
}
\description{
\code{scatterplot_generator} will pull information from \code{AGED} results to plot gene expression for each sample for a selected gene. The value in the original dataset will be plotted on the y-axis, and the user's choice of data taken from either the W matrix, H matrix, or W * H will be plotted on the y-axis. The column or row taken from the H or W matrix is chosen by which metagene the selected gene is the most prevalent in.
